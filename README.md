### Project Idea

This idea came from a tool called [OptiJuegos](https://optijuegos.github.io) called Optimizar PC. The code for the OptiTool foundations comes from this tool. Keep in mind that the newer versions of OptiTool are becoming a bit more independent. For version 5.0, we plan to have our own code.  
But I will never forget the origin of this idea, thanks to [OptiJuegos](https://optijuegos.github.io)!
